# 🎯 Referral System Implementation Summary

## What Changed

Your GROW game now has a **complete referral system** instead of single-use invite codes:

### Key Features
✅ **Multi-use referral codes** - Codes can be used unlimited times  
✅ **2% passive earnings** - Referrers earn 2% of all BUD generated by their referrals  
✅ **Automatic payouts** - Earnings distributed every second during gameplay  
✅ **Referral tracking** - Complete database tracking of who referred whom  
✅ **Earnings analytics** - Track total referrals and lifetime earnings  

---

## How It Works

### For New Players
1. Get a referral code from an existing player
2. Enter the 5-character code at signup
3. Create username + link wallet
4. Start playing - your referrer earns 2% of your BUD forever

### For Referrers
1. Get your own referral code created (or create one yourself)
2. Share your code with friends
3. Earn 2% of everything they generate
4. Passive income scales with number of referrals

### Earnings Example
```
You refer 10 players
Each generates 1000 BUD/minute

Your passive income: 10 × 1000 × 0.02 = 200 BUD/minute
```

## Database Schema Changes

### invite_codes Table
```sql
Before (Single-Use):
- code (PRIMARY KEY)
- is_used (BOOLEAN)
- used_by (TEXT)
- used_at (TIMESTAMP)

After (Referral System):
- code (PRIMARY KEY)
- owner_username (TEXT NOT NULL)      ← Who owns this code
- times_used (INTEGER DEFAULT 0)      ← How many used it
- total_referral_earnings (NUMERIC)   ← Lifetime earnings
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

### players Table - New Columns
```sql
- referral_code (TEXT)    ← Which code they used
- referred_by (TEXT)      ← Username of referrer
```

---

## Code Changes Summary

### 1. authSystem.js
**Before**: Checked `is_used = false` before allowing registration  
**After**: Only checks if code exists, increments `times_used`

```javascript
// OLD: Single-use validation
.eq('is_used', false)

// NEW: Multi-use validation
// Just check if code exists, no is_used check
```

### 2. supabaseClient.js - New Function
```javascript
async payReferralEarnings(playerId, budEarned) {
    // 1. Get player's referrer from referred_by field
    // 2. Calculate 2% of budEarned
    // 3. Add to referrer's total_bud
    // 4. Update invite_codes.total_referral_earnings
    // 5. Return success/failure
}
```

### 3. plantPlacement.js - Integrated Payouts
```javascript
generateBUDFromPlants() {
    // Calculate total BUD generated
    // Add to player's balance
    
    // NEW: Pay 2% to referrer
    window.supabaseClient.payReferralEarnings(
        currentPlayer.id,
        totalGenerated
    );
}
```

### 4. supabaseClient.js - Harvest Integration
```javascript
async harvestBUD() {
    const result = await harvest_bud();
    
    // NEW: Pay 2% when claiming offline earnings
    if (result.claimed > 0) {
        this.payReferralEarnings(
            this.currentUser.id,
            result.claimed
        );
    }
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

1. **Run SQL script** in Supabase:
   ```
   CREATE_INVITE_CODES_TABLE.sql
   ```

2. **Create test referrer**:
   - Use any SYSTEM code to sign up as `referrer_test`
   - Create code: `INSERT INTO invite_codes (code, owner_username) VALUES ('TEST1', 'referrer_test');`

3. **Create referred player**:
   - New browser/incognito window
   - Use code `TEST1` to sign up as `referred_player`
   - Place plants and wait for BUD generation

4. **Verify earnings**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM invite_codes WHERE code = 'TEST1';
   -- Check times_used = 1 and total_referral_earnings > 0
   
   SELECT id, total_bud FROM players WHERE id = 'referrer_test';
   -- Should show 2% of referred player's earnings
   ```

## SQL Queries for Management

### Create Referral Codes
```sql
-- Create code for a player
INSERT INTO invite_codes (code, owner_username) VALUES
    ('ALICE', 'alice_username');
```

### Check Top Referrers
```sql
SELECT 
    owner_username as "Referrer",
    times_used as "Total Referrals",
    total_referral_earnings as "Lifetime Earnings"
FROM invite_codes 
WHERE owner_username != 'SYSTEM'
ORDER BY total_referral_earnings DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### See Player's Referrals
```sql
SELECT 
    id as "Player",
    total_bud as "Their Total BUD"
FROM players 
WHERE referred_by = 'username_here'
ORDER BY total_bud DESC;
```

### Referral Network Stats
```sql
SELECT 
    i.code,
    i.owner_username,
    i.times_used,
    i.total_referral_earnings,
    p.total_bud as "Owner Total BUD"
FROM invite_codes i
LEFT JOIN players p ON p.id = i.owner_username
ORDER BY i.total_referral_earnings DESC;
```

## Important Notes

### Earning Distribution
- **Real-time**: Paid every second during active gameplay
- **Offline**: Paid when player claims offline earnings
- **Silent**: Errors don't interrupt gameplay
- **Automatic**: No user action required

### System Codes
- HERB1, GROW2, DOPE3, etc. are owned by 'SYSTEM'
- These codes work but don't generate payouts
- Used for initial player acquisition

### Limitations
- **Single-level only**: No multi-level marketing (you only earn from direct referrals)
- **Fixed rate**: 2% cannot be changed per-code (would need code modification)
- **No cap**: Unlimited referrals, unlimited earnings
- **Permanent**: Cannot change referrer after registration

### Future Enhancements
- Referral dashboard UI
- Real-time earnings notifications  
- Leaderboards for top referrers
- Custom code creation for players
- Referral milestones/bonuses
- Analytics and charts
